  ## Usage instructions

  After flashing your device allow some time for the application to download.

  WiFi-to-Ethernet will automatically join the configured WiFi network and present a DHCP server
  on its Ethernet port and route traffic from any Ethernet-connected devices to the WiFi network.

  If no WiFi network is configured in balenaOS, or the network isn't available, the included
  [wifi-connect](https://github.com/balenablocks/wifi-connect) container will allow you to
  select a WiFi network and provide the password.

  ## Known issues
  
  If you're using the using an *rtl8192cu*-based WiFi dongle on a Raspberry Pi 1/2 you
  **must** use *balenaOS 2.26.0+rev1* for the driver to work correctly.
